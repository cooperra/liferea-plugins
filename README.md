# Liferea plugins #

Place in ~/.local/share/liferea/plugins or what your `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
points to.

##  Disable Mark All As Read ##
Disables the menu entry for "Subscriptions" &rarr; "Mark All As Read" as it
is a little bit too easy to hit by mistake.

It does not disable the same functionality in the context menu for
feeds and folders.

##  Hide headline view ##
Adds a menu entry (View &rarr; Hide Headline View) and a keyboard shortcut
(Ctrl+H) to hide the headline view. 

Makes it easier (less scrolling) to read articles on small screens.
