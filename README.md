# Liferea plugins #
Place in ~/.local/share/liferea/plugins or what your `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
points to.

##  Disable Mark All As Read ##
Disables the menu entry for "Subscriptions" &rarr; "Mark All As Read"
as it is a little bit too easy to hit by mistake. Also disables the
toolbar button.

It does not disable the same functionality in the context menu for
feeds and folders.

##  Hide Headline View ##
Adds a menu entry (View &rarr; Hide Headline View) and a keyboard shortcut
(Ctrl+H) to hide the headline view. 

Makes it easier (less scrolling) to read articles on small screens.

##  Python Console ##
Interactive Python Console for Liferea! Simplifies writing and
debugging plugins. 

Based on the plugin for Rhythmbox, which in turn was based on gEdit and
Epiphany. 99.9% of the work is not mine, I do take credit for the new
bugs in this version.

## helpers ##
Not a plugin. Small utilities I re-use for plugins.
